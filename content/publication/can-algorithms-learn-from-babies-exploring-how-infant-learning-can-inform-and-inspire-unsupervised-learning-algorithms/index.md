abstract: Most of the recent success in machine learning has been achieved in
  supervised learning and predicated on the availability of large amounts of
  labelled training data. On the other hand, effectively using readily available
  unlabelled data has proven a much more difficult endeavour. In contrast to
  algorithms, infants spontaneously learn from the available sensory information
  without explicit instructions, supervision or feedback. Thus, infant learning
  can be viewed as a highly successful approach to unsupervised learning.  In
  this work, we explore the parallels between infant learning and recent
  successes of unsupervised machine learning in the area of contrastive
  learning. We examine how the principles of infant learning and developmental
  cognitive neuroscience can inform and inspire the development of novel
  contrastive learning algorithms. We focus on the phenomenon of category
  learning and explore how these principles can be applied to better understand
  and improve contrastive methods.
