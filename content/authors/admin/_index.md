My research explores how learning occurs in human minds and in machines. I want to understand the mechanisms and building blocks of learning. I study how fundamental cognitive abilities such as attention and memory, and language make learning, and ultimately intelligence, possible.    

I am particularly curious about how the mind learns to learn, and I study early cognitive development. I also use biologically-inspired neural networks to uncover the learning mechanisms in the brain, and explore how principles of early learning can be used to inspire more efficient machine learning algorithms, especially in the domain of multimodal and weakly supervised learning. As Turing beautifully pointed out, “instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s?
