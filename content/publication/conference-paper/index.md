abstract: In addition to its critical role in encoding individual episodes, the
  hippocampus is capable of extracting regularities across experiences. This
  ability is central to category learning, and a growing literature indicates
  that the hippocampus indeed makes important contributions to this kind of
  learning. Using a neural network model that mirrors the anatomy of the
  hippocampus, we investigated the mechanisms by which the hippocampus may
  support novel category learning. We simulated three category learning
  paradigms and evaluated the network’s ability to categorize and to recognize
  specific exemplars in each. We found that the trisynaptic pathway within the
  hippocampus—connecting entorhinal cortex to dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1—was
  critical for remembering individual exemplars, reflecting the rapid binding
  and pattern separation functions of this circuit. The monosynaptic pathway
  from entorhinal cortex to CA1, in contrast, was responsible for detecting the
  regularities that define category structure, made possible by the use of
  distributed representations and a slower learning rate. Together, the
  simulations provide an account of how the hippocampus and its constituent
  pathways support novel category learning.
