title: The role of labels and motions in infant category learning
abstract: We investigated the impact of two highly salient transient features,
  labels and motions, on novel visual category learning in 10-month-old infants.
  In three eye-tracking experiments, infants were presented with exemplars from
  two novel categories either accompanied by category-specific labels,
  accompanied by category-specific motions, or in silence. Labels (Experiment 1)
  and motions (Experiment 2) were presented using a gaze-contingent design in
  which these transient features were triggered by infants’ fixations.
  Gaze-contingent transient features, despite being redundant, had a strong
  impact on categorization. The results revealed that both labels and motions
  support infants’ category formation. Furthermore, both labels and motions
  promoted similarity-focused exploration, whereas no such pattern was found
  when infants learned the categories in silence. Analyses of visual exploration
  patterns revealed that infants readily form expectations about motion
  properties of categories and that these expectations drive their looking
  behavior.
