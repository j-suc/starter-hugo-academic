abstract: "A key question in categorization is how infants extract regularities
  from the exemplars they encounter. Detecting similarities and dissimilarities
  across items is vital in order to determine category-relevant features.
  Previous research found evidence that infants acquire a single category more
  easily with paired presentations in comparison with single presentations
  (Oakes & Ribar, 2005, Infancy, 7, 85; Oakes & Kovack-Lesh, 2007, Cogniție,
  Creier, Comportament / Cognition, Brain, Behavior, XI, 661). Here, we focus on
  infants’ acquisition of a category contrast, that is, when they are exposed to
  two categories. In an eye-tracking study, we examined 10-month-old infants’
  ability to learn two novel visual categories when presented with one item at a
  time and with items in pairs. Infants were familiarized with pairs of items
  from the same category or with pairs of items from different categories
  (cross-category pairs). Using a linear model with a priori contrasts, we show
  that infants’ learning is directly related to the opportunity for category
  comparison: There is no evidence of category learning in the single-item
  condition, improved performance when familiarized with same-category pairs,
  and finally robust category learning when familiarized with cross-category
  pairs. We conclude that comparison which involves items from different
  categories promotes category formation, by highlighting differences and
  promoting a discovery of category boundaries."
