abstract: Parents modulate their speech and their actions during infant-directed
  interactions, and these modulations facilitate infants’ language and action
  learning, respectively. But do these behaviors and their benefits cross these
  modality boundaries? We investigated mothers’ infant-directed speech and
  actions while they demonstrated the action-effects of 4 novel objects to their
  14-month-old infants. Mothers (N = 35) spent the majority of the time either
  speaking or demonstrating the to-be-learned actions to their infant while
  hardly talking and acting at the same time. Moreover, mothers’ infant-directed
  speech predicted infants’ action learning success beyond the effect of
  infant-directed actions. Thus, mothers’ speech modulations during naturalistic
  interactions do more than support infants’ language learning; they also
  facilitate infants’ action learning, presumably by directing and maintaining
  infants’ attention toward the to-be learned actions.
